## Hi, I'm Eva and I'm in love with **Coding** :computer:

Since I discovered Coding through Python :snake: I cannot stop exploring the newfound coding universe cause there seems to be so much to discover. :-)


That's why I completed an 8-month full stack bootcamp and a class in software testing.

Now I also love PHP. And SQL. And Docker...

Check out my latest projects here.
